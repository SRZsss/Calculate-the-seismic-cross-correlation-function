Calculate the seismic cross-correlation function
This is a convenient code for calculating noise cross-correlation function written by the CSIM team led by Professor Li Jing, Jilin University.
sg=Vsg (Noisedata, dt, wt), the corresponding noise cross-correlation function can be output, where dt is the sampling interval and wt is the segmentation window.
只需sg = Vsg(Noisedata,dt,wt)，便可输出对应的噪声互相关函数，其中dt为采样间隔，wt为分割时窗。
